Instead of manually counting student participation in discussions, this project aims at helping instructors keep track of participation for their Canvas courses. After running the script, Instructors will get access to a spreadsheet detailing the name of each forum topic, students who participated in each forum, their tally count, and the total number of posts each student has made in all of the discussion forums. This project is written in Python and uses web scraping as the core.

How to use:

1 - Create a folder anywhere on your computer
2 - Make a text file named "names.txt" within the folder and write each student's name (FIRST LAST) on a new line
3 - Download the HTML files of the discussion webpages and store them in the same folder you've created
4 - Open up command line and navigate to the newly created folder with names.txt and the HTML files
5 - Enter "python participation_counter.py" to run the script
6 - Copy and paste the path to the folder. Press enter.
7 - Viola!

Be sure to check your newly created folder for the generated spreadsheet storing each student's participation info.
